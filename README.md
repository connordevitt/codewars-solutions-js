## Introduction
This repository is a collection of my JavaScript solutions to challenges on CodeWars.  
Each problem has been solved with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and code readability.

## Structure
Solutions are categorized into difficulty levels:
- **/Easy**: Beginner-friendly challenges.
- **/medium**: Intermediate challenges.
- **/hard**: Chad level challenges. These guys use Vim.
- **/Level_Up**: Watch me climb the leaderboard with each level up!


### Example Files:
- `number_to_strings.js` We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.
- `reversed_strings.js`: Reverses a string.
- `are_you_playing_banjo.js`: Determines if someone plays banjo.
- `digitize_reversed_array.js`: Converts a number into reversed digits.
- `sentence_smash.js` Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence.
- `Array.Diff` Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result. 
- `Vowel_Count.js` Write a function which returns the number of vowels within a lower case input field. 
- `Descending_Order.js` take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order.
- `School_paperwork.js` Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need. If n < 0 or m < 0 return 0. n are classmates and m pare paperwork pages.
- `sum_arrays.jsx` Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. The numbers can be negative or non-integer.
- `Testing123.js` Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.
